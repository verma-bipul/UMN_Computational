- ps_1 : Solves simple growth model using VFI, and LQ approximation (Vaughan).
- ps_2 : Solves distorted growth model using LQ approximation and log-linearization (need to match log-linearizatrion and LQ results)
- ps_3 : Estimates parameters of different stochatic processes using Kalman Filter
- ps_4 : Estimates basic Aiyagari Model using Finite Elements Method
