Directories 

1. Ellen    
This dicretory contains codes for Prof. Ellen's part.    
Subdirectories:
- ps_1 : Solves simple growth model using VFI, and LQ approximation (Vaughan).
- ps_2 : Solves distorted growth model using LQ approximation and log-linearization (results vary a bit need to check why?)
- ps_3 : Estimates parameters of different stochatic processes using Kalman Filter
- ps_4 : Estimates basic Aiyagari Model using Finite Elements Method.


2. Bhandari     
This dicretory contains codes for Prof. Bhandari's part.   
Subdirectories:
- ps_1 : Estimates AR1 parameters on us gdp growth using Kalman Filter and EM algorithm.
- ps_2 : Replicates some results from AMSS(2002).
- ps_3 : Solves Aiyagari Model with labor supply using Endogenous Grid Method (EGM).
- ps_4 : Solves the Krussel-Smith model.
