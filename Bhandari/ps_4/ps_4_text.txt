Aiyagari economy with aggregate shocks

Modify the shocks as follows

Let z_g = 1.01, z_b  = 0.99 be the aggregate states. An agent can be either employed e_t = 1 or unemployed e_t = 0 in each period. The employment
status e_t follows a first-order Markov process with the transition matrix pi (z,e|z_,e_). 

Use the following information to obtain the transition matrix pi (z,e|z_,e_)

 

(i)   average duration of both an expansion and a recession is 8 quarters.

(ii)  average duration of unemployment during expansions is 1.5 quarters,

(iii) average duration of unemployment in recessions is 2.5 quarters,

(iv) unemployment rate in expansions is 4%,
(v) unemployment rate in recessions is 10%,

(vi) pi (e=0,z=z_b |e_=0,z_=z_g) = 1.25  pi (e=0,z=z_b |e_=0,z_=z_b)   

(vii)pi (e=0,z=z_g |e_=0,z_=z_b) = 0.75  pi (e=0,z=z_g |e_=0,z_=z_g)   

Compute the equilibria and report the usual business cycle statistics, that is, std and correlations between output, consumption, investment. You need to do both the parts below  

1. Solve using the method as described in Krusel Smith

2. Solve using Reiter's method

Please submit separate codes for the two parts.
